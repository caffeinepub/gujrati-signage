REQ-28 (plain white wordmark across header+footer) is only evidenced for the Wordmark component itself; the provided diff summary text indicates the Footer still uses a golden wordmark. REQ-29 (email update everywhere) cannot be fully verified from the truncated ContactSection diff and no other occurrences are shown.",
