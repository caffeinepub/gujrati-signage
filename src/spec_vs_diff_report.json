Several requirements appear implemented, but some key details cannot be confirmed from the diff summary (notably presence of required static image assets and exact intro prompt text), and some unrequested authentication/actor plumbing was introduced.",

      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Helper character asks the exact text “How can I help you?” (English) in the intro interaction.",
      "reason": "The implemented overlay message is “How can I help you today?” which does not match the exact required wording.",

      "reason": "UI references a logo at “/assets/brand/whatsapp-logo.jpeg”; the diff does not show inclusion of the specified uploaded filename, so it’s not verifiable that the provided upload is used as-is.",

      "reason": "Components reference many required image paths under /assets/generated, but the diff summary does not include the added static image files themselves (and the icon sprite is not referenced). Without the asset files in the diff, the requirement cannot be confirmed as implemented.",
