# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a single-page, premium, minimal, fully responsive marketing website for Gujrati Signage (Established 1960) with a cinematic feel, subtle 3D visuals, smooth micro-animations, and an intro phone + helper interaction.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a one-page layout with sections: Hero, About Us, Our Services (interactive 3D cards), Work Showcase/Gallery, Why Choose Us, Contact.
- Implement premium black/white/metallic-silver/soft-neutral styling with sophisticated typography, balanced whitespace, and smooth section transitions/parallax.
- Build the Hero with the headline “Crafting Signage Excellence Since 1960”, a subtle animated 3D signage/light-board element, scroll cue, and CTAs (“Contact Us”, “View Our Work”) that scroll to their sections.
- Add a first-load intro animation: phone UI pops up, a Bitmoji-like helper character “Vikrant Patel” appears with “How can I help you?” plus at least 3 quick actions (e.g., Contact, Services, View Work) and a dismiss/skip control.
- Implement About Us copy emphasizing legacy since 1960, precision, trust, and craftsmanship with subtle text reveal animations.
- Implement Services with six premium 3D cards (Building Signages, Name Plates, Number Plates, Light Boards, Custom Sign Boards, Radium Stickers) with hover/press interactions and accessible focus states.
- Implement a Work Showcase/Gallery with multiple high-quality images and smooth transitions, using light/dark depth treatment.
- Implement Why Choose Us with the four provided points and minimal animated icons.
- Implement Contact section with clear details and interactions: click-to-call for 9828939660 / 9828054199, mailto for vikratpatell77.vp@gmail.com, and Instagram/Facebook links opening in a new tab with refined hover/focus states.
- Add SEO-friendly structure: semantic sections, proper heading hierarchy (single H1), page title/meta description referencing “Since 1960”, and accessible alt text.
- Use the uploaded image as the brand/logo asset (e.g., header/hero) and ensure it remains crisp and legible on light and dark backgrounds.
- Add the requested generated static images as local assets and reference them in hero/services/gallery/intro (no backend image generation or serving endpoints).

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can land on a premium single-page Gujrati Signage website with a skippable intro helper, smoothly scroll through animated sections, view services and work gallery, and quickly contact the business via call/email/social links.
