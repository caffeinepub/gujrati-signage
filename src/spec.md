# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh branding readability, correct contact email, expand Services with new image-based items, and add desktop nav hover details.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the “Gujrati signage” wordmark to plain white with a premium font treatment, ensuring readability in header/footer across scrolled/unscrolled and light/dark states.
- Replace the contact email address and all mailto links site-wide with: vikrantpatel77.vp@gmail.com.
- Add new image-based service cards to the Services section for: Hospital Boards, Reception Boards, Steel Letters, Neon Signs, Glow Sign Boards (each with an image and short English description) matching existing card layout/hover/scroll-reveal behavior.
- Add desktop-only header navigation hover panels/tooltips that show 1–2 lines of brief details per nav item without affecting clicking/smooth-scroll; keep mobile navigation unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** The site shows a clean white “Gujrati signage” wordmark, the correct email everywhere, additional Services cards with images and descriptions, and desktop nav items reveal brief section details on hover.
